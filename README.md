# The 5-column setup

1. Install [SizeUp](http://www.irradiatedsoftware.com/sizeup/)
2. Install [FastScripts](https://www.macupdate.com/app/mac/11432/fastscripts)
3. Put the 5-Column directory in this repo in `~/Library/Scripts` (create the folder if it's not already there)

Now you have shortcuts for 8 different combinations of a 5-column vertical grid.

Open up FastScripts Preferences from the toolbar menu, and go to `Script Shortcuts`.

The naming convention of the shortcuts is `column index/column width`, e.g. 0/1 is far left, 1 column wide.

Here's how mine are set up, this configuration works nicely with the number pad, but hey, you do you.

Each of these key combos is set up to be ctr-opt-cmd and then the number that follows.

0/1: 1
0/2: 4
0.4: 7
1/2: 5
1/4: 9
2/2: 2
3/2: 6
4/1: 3
